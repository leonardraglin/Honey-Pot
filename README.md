# Honey-Pot

## Objective
This SSH honey pot creation was for the purpose of manufactured attack target to lure cybercriminals away from legitimate targets.  The primary focus was to design a honey pot to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of setting a cybersecurity trap.
- Proficiency in linux commands to create a working honeypot.
- Ability to recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Cloud computing system such Azure to set up a virtual machine.
- Github to find a solid the fits our needs.
- Linux to run the docker that setup the honeypot.

## Steps

Step 1: Setup virtual machine via cloud computing serive.

Step 2: Run cowrie in Docker locally with creating your own image.

Step3:  Then run an SSH client to port 2222 to test it.

Step 4: Let the honeypot run and collect data for any possible attacks.

Step 5: Testing thr honeypot we used Nmap to see what attackers see when they are poking around.
